# Activities
### Study Abroad
- I am currently studying abroad in Dublin, Ireland during the fall semester of 2024 at Dublin City University. This culturally-enriching experience has allowed me to grow in character as I have learned to navigate a new way of life surrounding my education.
  - **Global Perspective in Technology**
    - The relevant courses at DCU I am taking include Computer Architecture, Theory of Computing, Probability and Statistics. Studying computer science abroad has given me exposure to how different countries approach technology and education. This experience has helped me understand the global impact of different ways to approach problem-solving.
  - **Networking with International Peers and Professors**
    - Interacting with my Irish peers has been broadened my academic network and allowed me to understand the education system abroad and how it has compared to my experience in the United States.  
  
### Notre Dame DanceCo
- As a DanceCo club member, I learn to manage time effectively while attending classes and going to tri-weekly practices to prepare for the end-of-semester recital. I also practice communication and collaboration with fellow members while exhibiting excellent teamwork and a strong work ethic.
  - **Time Management**
    - Each DanceCo rehearsal is a 45 minute slot per week. I have always been in >5 dances per-semester which means that I have successfully balanced homework, my social life, and my dance commitments.
  - **Maintaining Good Health**
    - Another benefit of DanceCo has been the positive impact it has had on my mental and physical health. I am always looking for more ways to increase my quality of life and I believe that surrounding myself with hardworking individuals has encouraged me to strive for positive growth. 

# Societies
### Society of Women Engineers (SWE)
- SWE has shaped my identity as a woman in engineering, as it has boosted my confidence in pursuing a career in a traditionally male-dominated field. As a member, I have developed excellent communication skills from attending various workshops (resume, interview, etc.). Furthermore, collaborating with women from different engineering disciplines has allowed me to gain diverse perspectives on the difference in interdisciplinary approaches to problem-solving and innovation.
