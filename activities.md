# Activities
### Study Abroad
I am currently studying abroad in Dublin, Ireland during the fall semester of 2024 at Dublin City University. This culturally-enriching experience has allowed me to grow in character as I have learned to navigate a new way of life surrounding my education.
- **Global Perspective in Technology**
  - The relevant courses at DCU I am taking include Computer Architecture, Theory of Computing, Probability and Statistics. Studying computer science abroad has given me exposure to how different countries approach technology and education. This experience has helped me understand the global impact of different ways to approach problem-solving.
- **Networking with International Peers and Professors**
  - Interacting with my Irish peers has been broadened my academic network and allowed me to understand the education system abroad and how it has compared to my experience in the United States.  
  
### Notre Dame DanceCo
As a DanceCo club member, I learn to manage time effectively while attending classes and going to tri-weekly practices to prepare for the end-of-semester recital. I also practice communication and collaboration with fellow members while exhibiting excellent teamwork and a strong work ethic.
- **Time Management**
  - Each DanceCo rehearsal is a 45 minute slot per week. I have always been in >5 dances per-semester which means that I have successfully balanced homework, my social life, and my dance commitments.
- **Maintaining Good Health**
  - Another benefit of DanceCo has been the positive impact it has had on my mental and physical health. I am always looking for more ways to increase my quality of life and I believe that surrounding myself with hardworking individuals has encouraged me to strive for positive growth.

### Farley Hall Head Merch Commissioner
As the head commissioner of the merch team for my dorm at Notre Dame, I am tasked with communicating with the hall executives in order to create fashionable designs for my community to show their dorm pride.
- **Communication Skills**
  - Because of my role as the communicator between my commission and the hall executives, my communication skills have developed greatly. In this role I have had to make sure to relay important information and deadlines to my team while also sending designs to hall executives.
- **Graphic Design**
  - I have been on the merch commission for the past two years and have developed graphic design skills as a result. My creativity has allowed me to create designs that I believe will be well-liked by my commmunity and it is gratifying seeing my fellow residents repping my designs.  
- **Leadership**
  - In this role, I have had to set deadlines with my team to produce designs in an orderly manner. Furthermore, I also communicate with my team which types of merchandise we are looking to sell and will collaborate with hall executives to choose the most fitting design. Additionally, during merch sale season, I set the schedule for my team members and when it is their shift to sell merch.
  
# Societies
### Society of Women Engineers (SWE)
- SWE has shaped my identity as a woman in engineering, as it has boosted my confidence in pursuing a career in a traditionally male-dominated field. As a member, I have developed excellent communication skills from attending various workshops (resume, interview, etc.). Furthermore, collaborating with women from different engineering disciplines has allowed me to gain diverse perspectives on the difference in interdisciplinary approaches to problem-solving and innovation.
