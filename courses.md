# Relevant Courses and Projects
### Courses
- Fundamentals of Computing, Introduction to Embedded Systems and the IOT, Discrete Math, Integrated Engineering and Business, Drawing I, Linear Algebra, Systems Programming, Data Structures, Logic Design, Computer Architecture, Theory of Computing, Probability and Statistics
- Currently taking: Programming Paradigms, Operating Systems, Human-Computer Interaction, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

### Coursework
Through the Notre Dame computer science curriculum, I have gained experience using GitHub to turn in assignments for the following classes:
- **Systems Programming**
  - Explored the fundamentals of computing systems by focusing on the Unix programming environment. I examined topics like various command line utilities, files, processes, memory management, system calls, data structures, networking, and concurrency, all of which were reflected in assignments and exams.
  - Coded in C, Python, and Bash
- **Data Structures**
  - Explored the fundamental techniques in the design and analysis of non-numerical algorithms and their data structures. I examined topics like elementary data structures such as lists, stacks, queues and more advanced ones such as priority queues and search trees along with design techniques such as divide-and-conquer in the context of sorting and searching and graph algorithms.
  - Coded in C and Python
  
### Projects
Throughout my time at Notre Dame, I have had the opportunity to work hands-on through group projects in both classes and internships.
  - **2024 Summer Internship**
    - [Summer 2024 Research Overview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JLobanMghU0BThjfUFPfDm1kEdzmRJpL/view?usp=sharing)
    - [Hybrid Volatile and Non-Volatile CIM based on FeFETs for Accelerating Transformer Workloads](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P4pBL-zz1--QVW3dRFTsC1Wwn25Hj_hl/view?usp=sharing)
    - This summer I had the opportunity to collaborate with two other Notre Dame students to code a simulator in Python for the emerging 1FeFET-1C technology. This presentation is an overview of our research and was presented to our colleagues and supervisor at Ecole Centrale during the summer. This simulator and corresponding research will be showcased in a paper at the upcoming Design, Automation and Test in Europe (DATE) Conference I co-authored titled: *Hybrid Volatile and Non-Volatile CIM based on FeFETs for Accelerating Transformer Workloads*.
  - **Drawing I**
  - [Ballerina](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1emdz7ZQTJJ5bHfRkQt4K132BWNIVMSZM/view?usp=sharing)
  - [Great Smoky Mountains](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H-93QybeeQ5jiNUwQInK9hgEkCDstzrH/view?usp=sharing)
  - [Still Life](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ICoFSmROLnApCvNZvzijbLjBshAWgIiG/view?usp=sharing)
  - [Notre Dame](https://drive.google.com/file/d/152YbyKDKzlaQMf7OAA_uCNZii7nX-O1h/view?usp=sharing)
    - Although Drawing I is not a computer science class or even required for the degree, I learned that there are many similarities in drawing and programming. An artist solves the "problem" of how to depict a concept visually, while in programming, a developer designs an algorithm to solve a computational problem. Both require attention to detail, creativity, and problem-solvinng skills. In the Drawing I class I took at Notre Dame, I learned how to depict ideas I constructed in my head to fulfill an open-ended prompt - much like if I were visualizing an algorithm to solve some coding problem. I have attached several of my pieces here.
  - **Embedded Systems and the IOT** 
    - [Embedded Systems Arduino Alarm Clock](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fqGMwwIqGyOh9vdnps0222qhOzG6_P9j/view?usp=sharing)
    - During the spring 2023 semester, I was tasked to create a device of our choice in a group of three using specific resources from our circuitry kit, programmed in Arduino C/C++. This paper was our final report and demonstrates the alarm clock I created along with the code.
  - **Integrated Engineering and Business** 
    - [Reverse Engineered Business Strategy Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OPbxqOaO6ukg5IDRSPB5XJKW22vLH17u/view?usp=sharing)
    - During the fall 2023 semester, I collaborated with five other team members to analyze the business strategies of a company of our choosing, and in our case, Target. This report contains our in-depth analysis on Target's business model and showcases my knowledge of business in the context of engineering. This class was beneficial in my development as an engineering student because it helped me develop communication skills, managerial skills, financing accounting knowledge, and problem-solving skills.
