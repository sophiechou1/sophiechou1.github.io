# Relevant Courses and Projects
### Courses
- Fundamentals of Computing, Embedded Systems, Discrete Math, Integrated Engineering and Business, Linear Algebra, Systems Programming, Data Structures, Logic Design, Computer Architecture, Theory of Computing

### Coursework
- Through the Notre Dame computer science curriculum, I have gained experience using GitHub to turn in assignments for the following classes:
  - **Systems Programming**
    - Explored the fundamentals of computing systems by focusing on the Unix programming environment. I examined topics like various command line utilities, files, processes, memory management, system calls, data structures, networking, and concurrency, all of which were reflected in assignments and exams
    - Coded in C, Python3, and was introduced to Linux
  -  **Data Structures**
    - Explored the fundamental techniques in the design and analysis of non-numerical algorithms and their data structures. I examined topics like elementary data structures such as lists, stacks, queues and more advanced ones such as priority queues and search trees along with design techniques such as divide-and-conquer in the context of sorting and searching and graph algorithms
    - Coded in C and Python3
  
### Projects
- Throughout my time at Notre Dame, I have had the opportunity to work hands-on with a group through required class projects
  - **2024 Internship**
    - [Summer 2024 Research Overview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JLobanMghU0BThjfUFPfDm1kEdzmRJpL/view?usp=sharing)
    - This summer I had the opportunity to collaborate with two other Notre Dame students to code a simulator in Python for the emerging 1FeFET-1C technology. This presentation is an overview of our research and was presented to our colleagues and supervisor at Ecole Centrale during the summer. This simulator and corresponding research will be showcased in a paper at the upcoming Design, Automation and Test in Europe (DATE) Conference.
  - **Embedded Systems and the IOT** 
    - [Embedded Systems Arduino Alarm Clock](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fqGMwwIqGyOh9vdnps0222qhOzG6_P9j/view?usp=sharing)
    - During the spring 2023 semester, I was tasked to create a device of our choice in a group of three using specific resources from our circuitry kit, coded using ArduinoIDE. This paper was our final report and demonstrates the alarm clock I created along with the code.
  - **Integrated Engineering and Business** 
    - [Reverse Engineered Business Strategy Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OPbxqOaO6ukg5IDRSPB5XJKW22vLH17u/view?usp=sharing)
    - During the fall 2023 semester, I collaborated with five other team members to analyze the business strategies of a company of our choosing, and in our case, Target. This report contains our in-depth analysis on Target's business model and showcases my knowledge of business in the context of engineering. This class was beneficial in my development as an engineering student because it helped me develop communication skills, managerial skills, financing accounting knowledge, and problem-solving skills.
