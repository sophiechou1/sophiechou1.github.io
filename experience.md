# Experience
### Florist | January 2025 - Present
**Notre Dame, IN - Irish Gardens Flower Shop**
- As a florist, I create and deliver custom and professional floral arrangements while practicing good communication with coworkers and excellent customer service skills. This position has allowed my creativity to flourish, deepened friendships with coworkers, and taught me how to navigate a customer-centric model of business.

### Undergraduate Student Researcher | January 2024 - Present
**Notre Dame, IN - University of Notre Dame**
- During the spring semester of 2024 and currently the spring semester of 2025, I am an undergraduate student researcher studying AI transformer networks under guidance of Notre Dame professor Dr. Michael Niemier. This research position introduced me to research and allowed me to develop unique problem-solving skills. Furthermore, I collaborate with two other undergraduate students and Dr. Niemier's PhD students, which has sharpened my professional and technical communication skills.

### International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) Intern | May 2024 - July 2024
**Lyon, France - National Science Foundation**
- Project Title: IRES Track 1: Impact of Emerging Information Processing Technologies on Architectures and Applications – a U.S.—French Partnership
- I worked as a research intern during the summer of 2024, studying emerging technologies in the context of transformer networks and the effect of using different memory devices and architectures. My project was in collaboration with two other students, where our research focused on the proposed 1FeFET-1C device, which integrates a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) and a capacitor to create efficient, low-power, and non-volatile memory and logic circuits. Building upon our foundational work with transformer networks, we developed a Python simulation of the 1FeFET-1C transformer-encoding process which aimed to quantify latency and energy efficiency through the customization of various parameters. The 1FeFET-1C device will be proposed in a paper at the upcoming Design, Automation and Test in Europe (DATE) Conference, and I am honored to have been a part of the process. Furthermore, this research allowed us to create a visual analysis of the current in-memory computing landscape, which was presented at the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)'s Annual Review.

### JustLead Tutor | May 2023 - July 2023
**Knoxville, TN - Emerald Youth Foundation**
- I worked as a tutor for economically disadvantaged children from South Knoxville as my summer job before the start of my sophomore year. I tutored four kids aged 6-10 in math and reading to increase proficiency
before the start of the following school year. This job was incredibly gratifying as it was amazing to see the growth and impact I had on children who are behind in their education. Through this role I learned patience and further developed my communication skills.
